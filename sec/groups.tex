Fixing notation, let $\mathrm{S}_r$ be the symmetric group of $r$ elements and let $\mathrm{C}_r$ be the cyclic group of order $r$ thought of as the subgroup of $\mathrm{S}_r$ generated by an element~$\rho$.
We denote this inclusion by $\iota \colon \mathrm C_r \to \mathrm S_r$.

A \textit{resolution} in $\mathbf{Ch}_R$ is a quasi-isomorphism $P \to M$ with each $P_r$ being a free $R$-module.
We will use the fact, explained in Section 6.5 of \cite{jacobson1989algebra}, that such resolutions exist for any chain complex $M$ concentrated in non-negative degrees.

Let $\mathrm G$ be a group and $M$ an $R[\mathrm G]$-module.
The \textit{homology of $\mathrm G$ with coefficients in $M$}, denoted by $H(\mathrm G; M)$, is defined as the homology of the chain complex $P \otimes_{R[\mathrm G]} M$ where $P \to R$ is any resolution in $\Ch_{R[\mathrm G]}$.
We will be particularly interested in the case when $M = \mathbb F_p(q)$ is the trivial or sign $\mathbb F_p[\mathrm{S}_r]$-module depending on if the parity of~$q$ is even or odd respectively.

We now review the group homology of finite cyclic groups.
For any ring $R$ the elements
\begin{equation} \label{eq: T and R definition}
\begin{split}
T &= \rho - 1, \\
N &= 1 + \rho + \cdots + \rho^{n-1},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
in $R[\mathrm{C}_r]$ generate the ideal of annihilators of each other.
Therefore, the chain complex of $R[\mathrm{C}_r]$-modules
\begin{equation} \label{eq: minimal resolution}
\begin{tikzcd} [column sep = .5cm]
\mathcal W(r) = R[\mathrm{C}_r]\{e_0\} & \arrow[l, "\,T"'] R[\mathrm{C}_r]\{e_1\} & \arrow[l, "\,N"'] R[\mathrm{C}_r]\{e_2\} & \arrow[l, "\,T"'] \cdots
\end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
concentrated in non-negative degrees, with $\mathcal W(r)_d$ the free $R[\mathrm{C}_r]$-module $\mathcal W(r)_d$ generated by an element $e_d$, and differential induced from
\begin{equation*}
\partial(e_d) = \begin{cases}
Te_{d-1} & d \text{ odd,} \\
Ne_{d-1} & d \text{ even,}
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
defines a resolution $\mathcal W(r) \to R$ in $\mathbf{Ch}_{R[\mathrm{C}_r]}$.

It follows from a straightforward computation that for any prime $p$ and integer $q$
\begin{equation*}
H_i(\mathrm{C}_p; \mathbb{F}_p(q)) = \mathbb{F}_p.
\end{equation*}

The homology of $\mathrm{S}_r$ is harder to compute.
With untwisted coefficients, the method of computation followed by several authors was to prove the injectivity of this homology into that of the infinite symmetric group and take advantage of a natural Hopf algebra structure on it.
A powerful result stemming from the deep connection of this question with infinite loop space theory is the existence of a homology isomorphism of spaces
\begin{equation*}
\Z \times B\mathrm{S}_\infty \to Q(S^0) = \Omega^\infty \Sigma^\infty (S^0)
\end{equation*}

In this work, we are interested in the mod $p$ homology of $\mathrm{S}_p$ (with $p$ a prime) which, as explained in \cite[Corollary~VI.1.4]{adem2004milgram}, is detected by a group inclusion $\iota \colon \mathrm{C}_p \to \mathrm{S}_p$, that is, the map induced in mod $p$ group homology by $\iota$ is a surjection.
We now describe the kernel of this surjection.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem: Thom's theorem}
	Let $p$ be an odd prime and $q$ an integer.
	Consider
	\begin{equation*}
	(\iota_\ast)_d \colon H_d(\mathrm{C}_p; \mathbb{F}_p(q)) \to H_d(\mathrm{S}_p; \mathbb{F}_p(q))
	\end{equation*}
	then
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If $q$ is even, $(\iota_\ast)_d = 0$ unless there is an integer $t$ so that $d = 2t(p-1)$ or $d = 2t(p-1) - 1$.
		\item If $q$ is odd, $(\iota_\ast)_d = 0$ unless there is an integer $t$ so that $d = (2t+1)(p-1)$ or $d = (2t+1)(p-1)-1$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
	This is proven as Theorem 4.1 in \cite{steenrod1953cyclic} where Thom is also credited with a different proof.
\end{proof}

In Section 5 we will see how the mod $p$ homology of symmetric groups defines operations on the mod $p$ homology of algebras that are commutative up to coherent homotopies.
Preparing for that, we first develop the language of $\Gamma$-modules, operads, and props.
